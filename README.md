**PROPOSAL**
The website has one single page, which is static. It shows an A5 sheet of paper with "Enter Text Here" in the middle. You click and the text disappears. Now when you type a single letter it fills the entire sheet of paper. Additional text gradually reduces the total font size to fit the page. This continues until the page is filled with text just about readable (size 8?), at which point no more text can be added. In a corner of the A5 sheet is a watermark of "www.a5excerpts.com"

There is one button on the website: "share" which opens save to device and print options.

**PLAN**
A5 - 2480 x 1748px

Paper rfce - FORM > TEXTAREA (can hold col & row in HTML) specify H + W in CSS
Share rfce - BUTTON > opens ALERT
Alert rfce - BUTTON X 2 (save to device / print)
